  The Transportation Research Board has unique and seemingly arbitrary requirements for manuscripts submitted for review. These requirements make it difficult to write the manuscripts quickly. Based on a TRB \LaTeX\ template and the `rticles` package, we develop a R Markdown template that meets the requirements of TRB guidelines.

# Introduction

The TRB Guide [@TRBGuide] has unique and somewhat arbitrary requirements
for papers submitted for review and publication. While the initial submission is
required to be in PDF format, submissions for publication in Transportation
Research Record must be in Microsoft Office format. On top of this, the
manuscripts must be line-numbered, captions are bolded and employ atypical
punctuation, and the references must be numbered when cited and then printed in
order.

It is assumed that the readers of this document have some significant level of
experience working with R and R Markdown. R Markdown [@xie2018] is a file format for 
making dynamic documents with R. Frank and Hartgerink [@frank2017] demonstrate 
some of the benefits of using R Markdown to write scientific papers.

# Usage of the TRB RMarkdown Template {#sec:setup}
## Installation
The prerequisites for using the template are:

1. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), tested on version 3.6.1
1. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) (recommended)
1. R packages: 
   - [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) and [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown), for rendering R Markdown files
   - [rprojroot](https://github.com/r-lib/rprojroot), for word count function in the template
   - [wordcountaddin](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin), for word count function in the template
   - [rticles](https://github.com/cities-lab/rticles), containing the TRB template
   - [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr) (recommended), RStudio addin for inserting citations

First install R and RStudio for your operating system, and then install these R packages and their dependencies within R or RStudio. Note that you'll need to install `wordcountaddin` and `rticles` from github:
```
   remotes::install_github("benmarwick/wordcountaddin")
   remotes::install_github("cities-lab/rticles")
```

## Usage
You can follow these steps to use the TRB template from RStudio (Select the "TRB Journal Article" template): https://github.com/rstudio/rticles#using-rticles-from-rstudio

Or use it outside of RStudio (change command to `template = "trb_article"`):
https://github.com/rstudio/rticles#using-rticles-outside-of-rstudio

# About the Template
## History
David Pritchard posted the original versions of the Latex template [@pritchard2019], 
on which this R Markdown template is based, in 2009 and
updated it in 2011, soon after TRB began allowing PDF submissions. Gregory
Macfarlane made significant adaptations to it in March 2012, allowing for Sweave
integration and automatic word and table counts. Ross Wang added an automatic
total word count and made some minor formatting modifications in July 2015. 
Emaasit [@emaasit2016] started an R Markdown template `trbRticle`, but it was incomplete
and the repository has been dormant for 3 years. Liming Wang created the R Markdown 
template inspired by and building on the previous work.

## Features
In addition to the powerful R Markdown functions of integrating text and code, the template 
has a number of features that enable quick and painless manuscript
authoring.

### Title Page
The TRB Latex template [@pritchard2019] created a custom `\maketitle` environment that
complies with the TRB guideline.

Near the bottom of the title page, TRB requires a count of the manuscript's
words, figures, and tables. This template creates the word counts automatically using
the `wordcountaddin` [@marwick2019] and `rprojroot` [muller2019] R package. 
Users need to input the figure and table counts in the YAML header, as there are many different ways to include figures and tables in R Markdown (e.g., using Latex, embedding R chucks, HTML etc) and counting them is difficult to automate, while not too hard to do manually. The word counts ignore the References,
YAML, code chunks and inline code, etc. See the README of the `wordcountaddin` [@marwick2019] if you need
to know what are included and ignored.

### Page Layout
The document has 1 inch margins as required, with the author's last names in the left
heading and the page number in the right. The authors heading will need to be
edited by the writers with the `authorheader` option in the YAML head of the R Markdown file. 
Paragraphs leading sections and subsections are not
indented, while all subsequent paragraphs in that section are. Section types are
defined as outlined by the TRB Guide [@TRBGuide].

The document is single-spaced in 12 point Times font. Times New Roman is a
proprietary font and is therefore not available by installation in open-source
software, while the differences between Times variants are negligible. Times New
Roman itself can be used in Mac OSX by compiling the generated latex file 
under \verb1xelatex1.

### Line Numbers
Manuscript line numbering is implemented using the \verb1lineno1 package. There
are options to change the font style and type, but the current settings work
well. Note that the line numbers refresh each page, and that blank lines do not
receive a number.  Line numbers and headers are not shown on the title page.

### Figure and Table Captions {#captions}

Figure captions in a TRB manuscript ought to be sentence capitalized, bolded, and
can be somewhat longer than in other journals, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:dnorm},
showing a Normal distribution as an example of captioning.

```{r dnorm, fig.cap="This is a random figure to test the counting functionality on the title page. It shows a Normal distribution with location 0 and scale 1. The multinomial probit model assumes that the error terms are distributed identically and independently following this pattern.", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

p1 <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3, 3)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) + ylab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL)
p1
```

Table captions are somewhat different, requiring initial capitals and are more of a title. An example of this is given in Table \ref{tab:versions}, showing the history of the TRB Latex template. Tables generated from R code chunks can be included too.

\end{table}

### Bibliography

This template uses the Transportation Research Record citation style file (http://www.zotero.org/styles/transportation-research-record) created by John Coburn 
for bibliography style. Users can use the Markdown syntax for citations (see https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html). 

As an example, it is very easy to add reference to Biogeme written by
Bierlaire [@Bierlaire2008;@Bierlaire2003] or to papers like those
written by Garrow et al [@Garrow2009] and Koppelman and Garrow [@Koppelman2005]. You can even go
back and refer to Biogeme [@Bierlaire2008;@Bierlaire2003] a second time.

The `citr` package facilitates inserting citations when using RStudio to write the R Markdown document [@aust2019].

# To Do's
A list of To Do's for the template

1. Switch to use [trb.bst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiehrosswang/TRB_LaTeX_tex/master/trb.bst) for bibliography style (?)

1. Add more examples of embedding R code chunks

1. Eliminate dependency on `bookdown` when cross-referencing figures and tables can work without `bookdown`

# Conclusion

To make this document from the R Markdown source, click the `Knit` button in RStudio or 
run `rmarkdown::render("path/to/file_name.Rmd")` in your R console after successfully
setting up the prerequisites and the template (Section~\ref{sec:setup}).

The R Markdown template lives at https://github.com/cities-lab/rticles, report any issues and feature requests at the [Issues page](https://github.com/cities-lab/rticles) there.

# Acknowledgements

The authors would like to thank Pritchard, Macfarlane and Wang for their work of the TRB Latex template, without which this R Markdown template would not be possible.
